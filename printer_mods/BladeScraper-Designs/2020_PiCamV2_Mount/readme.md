Simple bracket to mount a Raspberry Pi Cam V2 (unknown if V1 will work, don't have one to test) to a 2020 Extrusion.

Made for a Voron 2.4 but really it should work with any printer with 2020 extrusions I would think.  You will probably have to invert your camera rotation (180 degrees).  

It can be mounted anywhere on the top edge, as long as you have a cable long enough.  I chose to put mine in the back because my cable wasn't long enough to reach all the way from the Pi to the front top extrusion on my V2 350.

Install the bracket to the extrusion first, or at least, put the screw into the mounting hole in the bracket before putting the camera on, because once the camera is mounted it is harder to access the mounting screw for the bracket.
