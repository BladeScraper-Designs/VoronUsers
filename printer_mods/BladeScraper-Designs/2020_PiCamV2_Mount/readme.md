Simple bracket to mount a Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 (unknown if Cam V1 will work, don't have one to test) to a 2020 Extrusion.

Made for a Voron 2.4 but really it should work with any printer with 2020 extrusions I would think.  You will probably have to invert your camera rotation (180 degrees) in your Pi/Camera configuration as it's technically upside down.  

It can be mounted anywhere on the top edge, as long as you have a cable long enough.  I chose to put mine in the back because my cable wasn't long enough to reach all the way from the Pi to the front top extrusion on my V2 350.  The flex cable goes forward first, then flips around and goes back towards the rear panel.  This is to not put undue stress on the cable.  It is sandwiched between the top panel and the foam tape. Thus, the top panel can come off without disturbing the cable.  Less so with the rear panel, but that's pretty much unavoidable here.

Install the bracket to the extrusion first, or at least, put the screw into the mounting hole in the bracket before putting the camera on, because once the camera is mounted it is harder to access the mounting screw for the bracket.  You should be able to still get a hex key/driver in and tighten the screw, but the head of the screw will make it difficult to get completely in/out with the camera mounted due to the ZIF connector being in the way.

You can run the flex cable behind or in front of the rear panel.  If you run it in front, tape it down so it can't rub against the XY belts.  

BOM:</br>
1 x M3 T-Nut </br>
1 x M3x8 SHCS </br>
4 x M2x8 SHCS </br>
4 x M2 Nut </br>

I would probably recommend using loctite on the nuts.  Alternatively you can substitute M2x8 with M2x10 and use nylon locknuts.
