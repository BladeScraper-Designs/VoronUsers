Simple bracket to mount a Raspberry Pi Cam V2 (unknown if V1 will work, don't have one to test) to a 2020 Extrusion.  
Made for a Voron 2.4 but really it should work with any printer with 2020 extrusions I would think.  You will probably have to invert your camera rotation (180 degrees).  
It can be mounted anywhere on the top edge, as long as you have a cable long enough.
