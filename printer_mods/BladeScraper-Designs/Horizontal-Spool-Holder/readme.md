Based on the stock spool holder, this mod allows you to mount the spool holder to the horizontal top extrusions, rather than the vertical ones, to allow you to choose between more than just the front or back of the printer.  It's sized to fit a KVP 5lb spool or similar, with a 100mm wide area for the spool to sit in.  Just like the stock holder, it uses 4mm PTFE tubing to give the spool a nice smooth surface to ride on.
